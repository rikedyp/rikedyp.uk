Adám : Welcome everyone. You can ask questions here, and I'll forward them to Richard.
Adám : You're of course also free to just discuss stuff.
mac : Hello!
Davin : Good day, all!
Tom : hello
ab5tract : Hi all!
Curtis Jones : Morning here in San Jose
ronnie : please let me know if excel for macos is included
Stefan Kruger : Hello.
Adám : Copyable link: https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/XL2APL
Adám : If you have any questions, then feel free to ask here, and I'll forward to Richard.
RGS : what happened..?
David White : Where'd it go?
Adám : Oops, sorry about that. We should be back shortly.
Adám : @RGS @DavidWhite Now we know you were paying attention :-)
ab5tract : uh oh I'm busted ;)
ronnie : it is too early to pose the macos apl questions
ronnie : i shall wait until ve 18 supports the macos environment
RGS : there he goes again :P
RGS : oh, it must be some kbd shortcut RP has set...
Josh : @ronnie Feel free to post your questions here. Right now RP is demonstrating Windows Only COM Interfacting, but Adam can relay them at an appropariate time
Josh : interfacing*
ab5tract : @ronnie I don't think Office for Mac supporting OLE is up to Dyalog to decide
ab5tract : Office for Mac is notorious for being unable to do things that normal Office does
Adám : Right, OLE is part of the operating system, and macOS doesn't include OLE. Office applications can communicate with each other on macOS using an ad-hoc system, but 3td party tools cannot hook into that.
Adám : Now is a good time to ask questions to Richard here in the chat.
Ray Cannon : Clap Clap!
ab5tract : Golf claps!
Davin : I like it.
Adám : https://github.com/rikedyp/APL2XL and https://github.com/rikedyp/XL2APL
Richard Levine : I guess you could write VNA dialog boxes for users to enter data and then feed to an APL process for proceessing?
Richard Levine : VBA dialog boxes
Josh : @Richard Levin absolutely
ellis : can you see the excel formula that created the data?
User Richard P connected
David White : Thanks for the demos!
RGS : ty for the demos
ellis : if I have an excel xls file you see its value most cells have a formulas too
Josh : do you mean from APL @ellis
Josh : because you can from APL. Instead of getting .Value2 you can get .Formula
ellis : I mean (say) I read in an xls file as an array, can I ask to see the formula
ellis : great - mthanks Richard and Josh!
Ray Cannon : It reminds me of workd I tried to do with Lotus-123 under Windows 3.1
mac : Thanks
Ray Cannon : Many thanks
Curtis Jones : Thank you
Josh : Np. You'd be surprised at the things you can do with APL and Excel via OLE automation
Josh : Check out the documents Richard posted
